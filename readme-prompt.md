# Technical Front End Prompt

Background: Solace wants to see how you develop code and deliver a small project that would be similar to your day-to-day work at Solace.

Goal: The deliverable out of this should be a link to a Github repo, whatever documentation you might think would be helpful and ideally a working web app hosted somewhere publicly accessible.

Given the Star Wars JSON-based API (<https://swapi.co/>) create a web app that shows all the entries for one of the following categories: Planets, Spaceships, Vehicles, People, or Species. The main page should render all entries, with each one being clickable that renders a **new page** with more information. Each entry should include information for _at least two of its relationships._ (ie. if showing people, the main information page would list all the **films** and **species** that person belongs to)

Our main goal is to see how you put the pieces together, so feel free to be creative and have fun with it. Please ensure that you cover all of the acceptance criteria mentioned below but be sure to add your own spin on it and if you have to make tradeoffs in any area, that’s fine, just mention what and why in your documentation. Technical framework decisions are up to you (so long as they are in the JS/TS family). Make it sparkle!
